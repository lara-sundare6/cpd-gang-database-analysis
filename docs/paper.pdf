Chicago’s Gang Database

Introduction

In 2000, the Chicago Police Department (CPD) introduced the Statewide Organized Criminal Gang Database, known as SWORD, to track organized criminal gangs and their members. Over time, due to growing criticism, the database's name was changed to the Criminal Enterprise Information System (CEIS). Despite its establishment over two decades ago, there has been little transparency regarding its use and criteria for inclusion. This essay examines the history, implementation, and impact of the CEIS, focusing on its effects on community members, the involvement of various stakeholders, and the ongoing criticisms and calls for reform.

History and Evolution of the Gang Database

Chicago rolled out SWORD in 2000 to track organized criminal gangs and their memberships. However, the system has faced significant criticism over the years, leading to its rebranding as the Criminal Enterprise Information System. Despite its establishment on January 1, 2000, there are limited sources about its uses and definitions. Only in recent years has published information emerged, likely due to increased scrutiny of the database’s lack of policy and clarity.

Current Strategies and Criticisms

Gang violence in Chicago has been a longstanding issue. In just the first six months of 2021, there were at least 336 homicides. CPD's latest strategies to combat gang-related violence include the formation of the Criminal Gang Unit and Mayor Lori Lightfoot's Chicago Street Gang Ordinance. According to CPD Deputy Chief of Gang Investigations Gilberto Calderon, "The Gang Investigation Unit will focus on high-level investigations to take down organizations that drive the gun violence throughout our city." In contrast, Lightfoot's ordinance seeks to impose civil penalties on gangs that commit crimes. However, this ordinance has been criticized as a political move to show action and as a tactic against poor people of color with little legal representation. Overall, CPD and the mayor have not found proven and effective ways to combat gangs in Chicago, and the language they use is often ambiguous.

Impact on the Community

According to CPD's 2019 general order, "the purpose of the Criminal Enterprise Database is to collect and manage criminal and gang intelligence information to prevent, detect, and investigate criminal activity." However, the criteria for classifying someone as a gang member in the database are vague. If suspects admit they are in a gang or have gang tattoos, that counts. In some instances, police base the decision on what they hear from sources deemed reliable in the past. This fuzzy criteria can negatively impact the community.

The database contains 135,000 members, 95% of whom are Black and Latino. Those listed are not notified and could be arrested if found on the database during a stop by an officer. Additionally, being listed can affect job applications, as employers might discover this through background checks. The system also displays flaws, such as listing thirteen people as 118 years old and two as 132. The database is shared with 500 external agencies without meaningful agreements governing its use, including U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).

Case Study: Wilmer Catalan-Ramirez

On March 27, 2017, Wilmer Catalan-Ramirez, an undocumented immigrant with no criminal record, was arrested due to his listing on the gang database. Six ICE officers entered his home without a warrant and seriously injured him, despite his recovering from a drive-by shooting incident in January 2017. He was detained for ten months without medical care, resulting in potential lifelong partial paralysis.

In December 2017, the city of Chicago reached a settlement to remove him from the gang database and allow him to stay in Chicago while awaiting his immigration hearing. Catalan-Ramirez's case highlights the potential for abuse and the severe impact on individuals listed in the database.

CPD's Leadership and Policy Issues

CPD has failed to create a website providing general information about the CEIS policy or a process for citizens to appeal their presence on the database. The Office of the Inspector General's (OIG) 2021 inquiry revealed several issues, including the lack of a timeline for completion of the CEIS, unclear assignment of managerial responsibility, confusion within CPD over the drafting status of General Order G10-01-03, and ongoing reliance on flawed data.

The inquiry also found a lack of leadership, with key personnel leaving the project shortly after their appointment and no clear succession plan. This ambiguity and lack of accountability suggest that CPD is unwilling to address the significant flaws in the database.

Public and Legal Responses

In 2018, several organizations, including Chicagoans for an End to the Gang Database, brought an ordinance to the city council to regulate the gang database. The ordinance cited the disproportionate listing of Black and Latino people and the adverse effects on employment, housing, and immigration status. However, the motion was voluntarily dismissed by the plaintiffs, who sought harm reduction through litigation. Since then, CPD has made minimal changes in response to criticisms.

Conclusion

The status and use of the gang database are deeply flawed and require immediate reform. It is concerning that individuals' lives are jeopardized by an underdeveloped technology. The database's disproportionate impact on Black and Latino communities and the lack of due process for those listed highlight the need for comprehensive changes or the database's abandonment. Public education, community organizing, and participation in policy discussions are essential steps toward addressing these issues.
